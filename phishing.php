      <p>Phishing is like a digital form of fishing, where cybercriminals use tricks to try and catch your personal and sensitive information, just like a fisherman tries to catch fish. Here's a simple explanation for people of all ages:

      Imagine you get an email, text message, or even a website that looks like it's from a trustworthy source, like your bank, a friend, or a popular online service. It might ask you to click on a link, enter your username and password, or provide your credit card details. However, this message is a fake, and the people behind it are actually trying to steal your personal information.
